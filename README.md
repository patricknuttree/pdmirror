# Welcome to PDMirror!
![ Logo]()

### PDMirror is a yelp inspired app that is designed to help communities and police departments have real and meaningful communication through a medium that removes some of the power dynamics that create limitations in the communications. The name and the purpose of the app all come from the same sociological theory of the sociological mirror. A person cannot determine the normalcy or deviancy of their actions through their own perspective alone. They must use the world as their mirror to determine where their action lands and from there grow.
